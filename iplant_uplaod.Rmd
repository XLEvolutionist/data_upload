This document details the process of receiving the Palmar Chico popultation of teosinte. The data arrived on two 3TB external hard-drives. The first thing to do before transferring the data to iPlant data store is to `md5` checksum all the files, so that once they are transfered we cna check the integrity of the file following the transfer. 

In order to `md5` checksum all the files we can use a combination of unix `find` and the `ms5` algorithm. For example the following shell script will provide a list of files and their md5 checksums.
```
#/usr/bin/bash

files=$(find /dir/ -type f -name "*.gz" -name -not ".*")

for i in ${files}; do
  md5 $i
done

```
